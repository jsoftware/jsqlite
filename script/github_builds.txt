github builds

Whenever the jsqlite repo is updated, the JSQLITE binaries are built and standard tests are run.

The process is defined in the repo workflow:

  .github/workflows/jsqlite.yml

This workflow calls files in the repo script:

  buildga.cmd   - windows builds

  buildga.sh    - non-windows builds

Builds take place on runners which are machines created dynamically for each OS.

If there is any failure, the entire workflow is halted.

To see the status of a run, login to github and visit:

  https://github.com/jsoftware/jsqlite/actions

Recent runs are shown with a status mark. Drill down into a run name for the compile logs.

If a run completes successfully, the JSQLITE binaries and test results are written to github area:

  https://github.com/jsoftware/jsqlite/releases/tag/build

If the version is updated in the repo version.txt file, then after the first successful build the JSQLITE binaries are copied to the corresponding download area on the J webserver, e.g.

  https://www.jsoftware.com/download/sqlitebin

Github actions are documented at https://docs.github.com/en/actions
